#  Quantification of central pivots in Brazil using Computer Vision

## Intro

A transformation of Hough and Canny Edge Detector are digital processing techniques that allow the detection of contours in images. Both algorithms have the same objective, however they differ in the way of displaying it. A geometric shape of the main centers in the image allows them to find and through computer vision a count of these targets is made.

## Objective

- Understand the operation of computer vision algorithms in the detection of central pivot geometries;
- Analyze and survey the distribution of irrigation by central pivot in the Luís Eduardo Magalhães mesoregion through remote sensing;

## About the Dataset

The data collected from catalog of satellite images that are available on the Earth Explorer website belonging to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) available at (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) was analyzed using an application programming interface (API) accessible over the Internet in an interactive development environment (IDE) associated with the Web, available in JavaScript, which allows the creation of prototypes and the quick visualization of results, such a platform called Google Earth Engine Code.
